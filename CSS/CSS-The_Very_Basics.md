# What is CSS?

## What is it?

CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - how they are arranged and styled.

## What does it stand for?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

# Including Styles Correctly

## Inline Styles

You can write your styles directly inline on each element, but this is **NOT A GOOD IDEA** most of the time.
  
## The `<style>` element

You can write your styles inside of a `<style>` element. This is easy but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents. **Not recommended either**.

## External Stylesheet

Write yourr styles in a *.css* file, and then include the file using a `<link>` in the head of your html document. **Recommended!**
