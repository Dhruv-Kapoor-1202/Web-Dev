# What exactly is HTML5?
  
HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines **HTML**. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviours, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and appplications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.  
  
## Living Standard

The HTML standard is a document that describes how HTML should work.

## Role of Browsers

The standard describes the rules of HTML, but browsers actually have to do the work and implement HTML according to those rules.

## HTML5?

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. It includes new elements and features for browsers to implement.
  
# Block vs. Inline Elements - Divs and Spans

- Inline elements fit in alongside other elements
- Block level elements take up a whole "Block" of space
  
## **`<div>`** : The Content Division Element

It is the generic container for flow control. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.  
  
## **`<span>`**

The HTML `<span>` element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the **class** or **id** attributes), or because the share attribute values, such as **lang**. It should be used only when no oter semantic element is appropriate, `<span>` is very much like a `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element whereas a `<span>` is an inline element.

# An Odd Assortment of Elements: HR, BR, Sup & Sub

## hr: Horizontal Rule

- no closing tag  
- represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. 

## br: The Line break element

example: it could be used in a poem.

## sup: superscript 

## sub: subscript  

# Entity Codes

- Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon
- Used to display reserved characters, that normally would be invalid
- Also used in place of difficult to type characters
- The browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.

# Semantic Markup

Semantic = relating to meaning
